# captdriver - alternative driver for Canon CAPT printers

This is a fork of https://github.com/mounaiban/captdriver

It focuses on LBP3000 (could have broke support for others) and fixes the following:

* Incorrect paper dimensions
* Shifted printing after the first page
* Slow printing and delay before first print
* Inability to print pages larger than printer's RAM amount (streaming mode)
* Proper error and interal state handling

It is based on my reverse-engineering effors of captmon2 (LBP2900, LBP3000)
and captfilter Linux binaries, and USB data dumps from Windows XP Canon driver,
however all the code has been written by LLM assistant from my documentation,
experiments and observations.

Flaws:
* Does not continue printing after paper jams, no cartridge/opened door — filter terminates, you'll need to reprint manually

To make it work reliably, **you have to use CUPS v2.4.17+**, as it includes the fix for [USB race condition](https://github.com/OpenPrinting/cups/issues/1461).

-------------------------------------------------------------

**Captdriver an alternative driver for Canon laser printers**
that only support the proprietary CAPT communications protocol
and associated data stream formats.

It aims to be a portable and reliable driver that can extend the
service life of existing CAPT-only printers by extending support
to more platforms and newer operating systems.
